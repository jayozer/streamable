An Airtable data entery feature replacement with Streamlit and Snowflake /n

V1:
+ Add Authorization page
+ Side table list for Agency, Enterprise
+ Add `Push to Snowflake` button. 
- `Push to Snowflake` only appears when Admin password is used.
+ There should be Agency and Enterprise on side bar but both push into same Snowflake table. (Solved by a view!)

V2: 
Streamlit - experimental data editor add-ons
