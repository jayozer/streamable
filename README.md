An Airtable data entery feature replacement with Streamlit and Snowflake

- Add Authorization page
- Side table list for Agency, Enterprise
- Add `Push to Snowflake` button. But this button only appears when Admin password is used.
- There should be Agency and Enterprise on side bar but both push into same Snowflake table.
